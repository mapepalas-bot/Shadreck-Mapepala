 - My website contains a store that sells drugs, it is an interactive website because it to select the drug you need and add to cart.

 - 1. Five most challenging HTML elements to implement
    - `<table>`: Managing rows, columns, and accessibility attributes like `scope` was tricky.
    - `<form>`: Handling form validation, input types, and submission logic required careful attribute setup.
    - `<figure>` & `<figcaption>`: Properly associating images with captions for semantic meaning was initially confusing.
    - `<nav>`: Structuring navigation links semantically and styling them correctly took some effort.
    - `<header>` & `<footer>`: Understanding their semantic roles and placement in the document layout was challenging at first.

- Using semantic elements to structure content
    - `<header>`: Used at the top to contain the site title and navigation, defining the introductory content.
    - `<nav>`: Wrapped navigation links for clear site menu semantics.
    - `<section>`: Divided the page into logical sections like "products" and "contact".
    - `<article>`: Encapsulated individual product details as self-contained content blocks.
    - `<footer>`: Placed at the bottom for copyright and secondary links, marking the page's footer information.

 - Most useful element for organizing layout
    - `<section>`: It helped divide the webpage into thematic content groups (products, cart, contact), improving readability and structure. Semantic sections make styling and JavaScript targeting easier and enhance accessibility.
    - The three essential HTML attributes that typically make a website functional are:
1. *src`* – used in elements like `<img>` or `<script>` to specify the source URL of external files (images, scripts).
2. *`href`* – used in `<a>` (anchor) tags to define the link destination, enabling navigation between pages.
3. *`alt`* – used with `<img>` to provide alternative text for accessibility and fallback display, improving functionality for users and SEO.


 - Question 4: Development Process

 - How did you plan your website structure before coding?
I sketched a site map and wireframes to layout pages, navigation, and content hierarchy. I defined sections, relationships between pages, and chose semantic HTML elements for each part.

 - What was your approach to testing and debugging your HTML?
I used browser DevTools to inspect elements and validate markup. I ran the code through an HTML validator (e.g., W3C validator) to catch syntax errors and fixed them iteratively.

 - What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
I struggled with organizing complex nested elements. I overcame this by modularizing the layout into reusable components and using clear indentation and comments in the code.


Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation

 - What Git commands did you use during development?
I used `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branch`, `git merge`, and `git push` to manage the repository and upload code to GitHub.

  - How many commits did you make and what was your commit message strategy?
I made 12 commits. My messages were concise and descriptive (e.g., “Add header navigation”, “Fix validation errors”), focusing on the specific change made in each commit.

- Why is version control important for web development projects?
Version control tracks changes, enables collaboration, allows rollback to previous states, and maintains a history of modifications, making project management and debugging easier.


 -    Code Quality & Best Practices

  How did you ensure your HTML was valid and error-free?
I validated the HTML using the W3C Markup Validation Service and manually checked for syntax errors in the browser console, fixing issues until the code passed validation.

   What best practices did you follow for writing clean, readable code?
I used semantic HTML elements, proper indentation, meaningful comments, and consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs to improve readability and maintainability.

  How would you improve your website if you had more time?
I would add CSS for responsive design, enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes, optimize performance by minifying code, and implement JavaScript interactivity for a richer user experience.
